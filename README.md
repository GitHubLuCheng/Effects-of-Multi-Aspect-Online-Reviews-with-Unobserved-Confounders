# Effects-of-Multi-Aspect-Online-Reviews-with-Unobserved-Confounders
This repository contains the datasets used for the ICWSM'22 paper [Effects of Multi-Aspect Online Reviews with Unobserved Confounders: Estimation and Implication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01746.pdf).

Each dataset (i.e., Toronto and LV datasets) has two files: the .txt file contains the popular times of each restaurant; the corresponding information of this restaurant such as entire reviews and business ID can be downloaded at [LV_restaurants](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11YUQZAmRP_ydgGt4sAs5pA-47LGTS7dn/view?usp=sharing) and [Toronto_restaurants](https://drive.google.com/file/d/143jFIcH-ErCW6E7BFG09caAhqUtjGsHi/view?usp=sharing). You can use the business ID to access other information (e.g., location) of a restaurant in the [Yelp dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).
